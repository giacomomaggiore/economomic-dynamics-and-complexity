# Economics, Dynamics & Complexity — Course Repo

Made with love by [Giacomo Maggiore](https://giacomomaggiore.com)


### Short description
This repository contains teaching notebooks and exercises for the course "Economics, Dynamics & Complexity". It focuses on using network models and dynamical systems to study systemic risk, diffusion, resilience, and growth in economic systems.

### Learning objectives
- Understand complex networks and their role in economics
- Measure network structure and interpret economic implications
- Simulate dynamics on networks (contagion, diffusion, growth)
- Analyze systemic risk and policy implications using simulations

### How to use
- Open notebooks in VS Code or Jupyter, select a Python kernel (3.9+ recommended).
- Ensure lightweight dependencies are installed: numpy, matplotlib, ipywidgets, sympy.
- Enable ipywidgets in your environment for interactive sliders (@interact).
