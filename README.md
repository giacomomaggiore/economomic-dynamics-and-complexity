> **Course short description**  
> What drives systemic risk in financial markets? How do global supply networks shape trade?  
> This course studies those questions through the lens of complex networks: firms, financial institutions, and countries are modelled as nodes in networks whose interactions produce emergent macroeconomic behaviour. We combine theory, data, and Python-based simulation to learn how topology shapes contagion, resilience, and growth — and how network models inform policy.



## Course content & weekly schedule (suggested, 12 weeks)
**Week 0 — Introduction**
- Course overview, motivation, datasets, software environment, and project assignments.

**Week 1 — Foundations of network theory**
- Graphs, adjacency matrices, simple examples; visualization tools.

**Week 2 — Network topology & economic meaning**
- Degree distributions, small-worlds, scale-free networks; relation to markets and supply chains.

**Week 3 — Network metrics & economic interpretation**
- Centrality measures, clustering, assortativity, community detection; interpretation for market power and information flow.

**Week 4 — Models of network evolution**
- Preferential attachment, fitness models, economic incentives shaping network growth.

**Week 5 — Input–Output networks**
- Leontief framework, production networks, propagation of shocks through supply chains.

**Week 6 — Financial networks I**
- Interbank networks, exposures, basic contagion models (loss propagation, default cascades).

**Week 7 — Financial networks II**
- Balance-sheet networks, liquidity contagion, fire sales, and simulation studies.

**Week 8 — Trade & production networks**
- Global value chains, regional blocs, firm-level trade networks and fragility.

**Week 9 — Games and strategic interactions on networks**
- Coordination games, diffusion of behavior, bargaining and coalition formation.

**Week 10 — Dynamic processes & diffusion**
- SIR-like models for financial contagion, innovation/technology diffusion, cascading failures.

**Week 11 — Systemic risk, resilience & policy**
- Measuring systemic importance, stress-testing networks, interventions, regulation design.

**Week 12 — Student presentations & wrap-up**
- Final project presentations, code demos, policy takeaways.

## Data sources & example datasets
This repo includes small sanitized example datasets for teaching. For extended projects, common public sources include:
- World Input–Output datasets (WIOD / OECD)
- UN Comtrade (bilateral trade flows)
- BIS, IMF, or national central bank reports for financial exposures
- Firm-level trade and supply-chain databases (where permitted)
