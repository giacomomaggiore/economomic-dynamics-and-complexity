    "As you learned in this week's lecture, the traditional cobweb model describes a dynamic price adjustment process for a single non-storable good with a supply response lag. In this exercise, we will explore an extension of the model in which producers may choose which of two markets to sell in. In this extended model, the decision to enter one of two markets is repeated in every period and is based on the profits of the preceding period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-study is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We look at this model assuming there is no interaction between the two markets and derive the price update rule.\n",
    "2. We introduce the idea that firms can choose which market to sell in based on the profits of the preceding period.\n",
    "3. Finally, given this update rule, we will simulate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note we will use some Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to make the code more readable; if you are not familiar with OOP, don't worry, you can still follow the tutorial.\n",

    "### The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two markets, $A$ and $B$, and there is a fixed number of producers ($N$). In each round, a fraction $W_{At}$ is active in market $A$ and a fraction $W_{Bt}$ in market $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changes from Lecture:**\n",
    "For notation simplicity, I will use $i$ to denote either of the two markets and $j$ to denote the other. So for example, the share of suppliers in market $i$ is $W_{it}$ and that of $j$ is $W_{jt} = 1 - W_{it}$. Also, unlike in the lecture, I will assume that $N=1$; this has no effect on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each period, the market clears, which means that demand equals supply weighted by the share of suppliers in each market,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_{it} = W_{it} S_{it} \\qquad \\forall i \\in \\{A,B\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the basic cobweb model, we assume that the supply response is lagged. In other words, supply in market $i$ at $t$ depends on the price observed in the previous period $P_{it-1}$ and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{it} = \\frac{P_{it-1}-c_i}{d_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_i$ and $d_i$ are constants. Demand in market $i$, on the other hand, depends on the current $P_{it}$ and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_{it} = \\frac{a_i - P_{it}}{b_i}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**(Useful for logistic map)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To closely align a recursive function with its mathematical definition, we may choose to write a recursive function rather than an iterative one. What's the difference? A recursive function is one that calls itself, whereas an iterative function uses a loop to repeat a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the Fibonacci sequence, defined recursively as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we'd like to express this as `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)`. The closest python implementation is a self-calling function, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    elif n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function calls itself twice for different values of $n$.\n",
    "- The function includes a base case, i.e., it specifies the return value when $n$ is 0 or 1.\n",
    "- The function completes its execution only upon reaching this base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** If the base case is not properly defined or is missed, the function will never terminate, leading to a `RecursionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this function with large values of $n$ reveals its inefficiency, as it repeatedly calls itself for the same values of $n$. For instance, computing $F_5$ requires 15 calls, and computing $F_{50}$ requires an astonishing **2,692,537** calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the function actually needs to call itself only twice for a given $n$ (once for $n-1$ and once for $n-2$). By storing the computed values for each $n$, we can avoid redundant function calls. This technique is known as *memoization*. It can be implemented using the `lru_cache` decorator from the functools package.\n",
    "\n",
    "By memoizing the last three values, $F_{50}$ can be computed in just 51 calls. \n",
    "If in doubt about how many values to memoize, just use a large number like 1000, memory is cheap.\n",
